# SEACANAIRY CONFIGURATION FILE


Seacanairy settings:
  # Name of the folder in which the log and data files will be stored:
  Sampling session name: "seacanairy" #.csv
  # Amount of time between each consecutive measurement
  Sampling period: 60  # seconds


CO2 sensor:
  Automatic sampling frequency (number of sample during the above sampling period): 1
  Amount of time required for the sensor to take the measurement: 8  # seconds (Default value: 10 seconds)
  Store debug messages (important increase of logs): No
  Number of reading attempts: 3


OPC-N3 sensor:
  # Amount of time at which the fan keep running to refresh the air inside the sensor casing
  Flushing time: 2
    # Amount of time at which the laser is kept on and measure the air
    # This period will be multiplied by 2 because the sensor automatically take a
  # measurement in high gain and in low gain mode
  Sampling time: 5
  Fan speed: 100 # 0 = the slowest, 100 = the fastest
  Keep a record of all the technical data: Yes # bin number, sampling period, MToF...
  Take a new measurement if checksum is wrong (avoid shorter sampling periods when errors): Yes
  Store debug messages (important increase of logs): No
